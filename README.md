## 🧠 What I Learned

> Building this project helped me understand:

* ✅ How to create a simple but powerful image slider in React
* ✅ The use of `useState` for handling current slide index
* ✅ How `useEffect` is used to manage side effects like intervals
* ✅ `useRef` to store interval timer reference
* ✅ Managing hover state to pause/resume autoplay
* ✅ Dynamic class toggling for animations (`opacity-100`, `opacity-0`)
* ✅ Creating responsive layouts with Tailwind CSS
